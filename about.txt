3.  Create an index.html file within this directory.
4.  Within index.html - write valid HTML containing the proper 
    DOCTYPE, <html>, <head> and <body> tags.
5.  Within your page's body, add a paragraph that includes the phrase, "Hello World!"
6.  Create a new directory, within your project directory, called css.
7.  Create a new file, within the css directory, named style.css.
8.  Properly link this CSS file from within your index.html.
9.  Open your index.html file in your browser and review the results.
10. Within your CSS, change the color of all text on the page using body { color: red; }

the page.

Feedback
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer for general feedback only, it will 
not be evaluated for meeting specific technical expectations.


Submission
When you're ready to submit your project go back to your Nanodegree Portal, click on 
Intro Project, and follow the instructions to submit.

If you want to submit your code through a "Link to Project", upload your project files 
onto Github and send us the link. We hope you submit using your Github because that is 
how professionals submit their work. Please use a separate repository for each project.

If you instead want to submit your code through "Upload a Zip", compress your project 
directory, and submit that zip file.

It can take us up to 2 weeks to evaluate the project so keep checking back for updates.

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status 
of your submission, please email us at frontend-project@udacity.com.

Next Steps
Now that you have the basic structure of an HTML page up and running, continue 
on to the first project where you'll continue to enhance this into a comprehensive portfolio!
